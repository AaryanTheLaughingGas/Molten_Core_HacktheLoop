# üöÄ Synapse Copilot

Welcome to the Synapse Copilot, your gateway to effortlessly integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with a wide array of APIs! Follow this delightful guide to embark on your API scenario adventure. üéâ

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Quick Start

Let's dive right in and get you up and running with your very own API scenario!

### Step 1: Installation üê£

Kickstart your journey by cloning the GitHub repository and installing the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devsbeta/Beta-for-LLM-API-office.git
cd Beta-for-LLM-API-office
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Selecting and Adding a Scenario üéØ

It's time to craft your unique API scenario! Choose a captivating name (e.g., `trello`, `stablediffusion`, `google_sheets`) and follow these steps to make it a reality:

1. **Add the scenario name:** Open `model/api_llm.py` and add your scenario name to the `ApiLLM` class constructor.

```python
    def __init__(
            self,
            llm: BaseLLM,
            api_spec: ReducedOpenAPISpec,
            scenario: str,
            requests_wrapper: RequestsWrapper,
            caller_doc_with_response: bool = False,
            parser_with_example: bool = False,
            simple_parser: bool = False,
            callback_manager: Optional[BaseCallbackManager] = None,
            **kwargs: Any,
    ) -> None:
        if scenario not in [
            "tmdb", "spotify", "stable", "calendar", "notion", "upclick",
            "discord", "sheets", "trello", "jira", "salesforce", "your_scenario_name"
        ]:
            raise ValueError(f"Invalid scenario {scenario}")
```

2. **Provide the spec file:** Navigate to the `specs` directory and add your scenario's OpenAPI specification file.

3. **Configure your credentials:** In the `config.yaml` file, add your application's secret keys or tokens in this file:

```yaml
OPENAI_KEY: "YOUR OPENAI API KEY"

TMDB_ACCESS_TOKEN: "YOUR TMDB ACCESS TOKEN"

spotipy_client_id: "YOUR SPOTIFY APPLICATION CLIENT ID"
spotipy_client_secret: "YOUR SPOTIFY APPLCIATION CLIENT SECRET"
spotipy_redirect_uri: "URL TO YOUR APPLICATION"

YOUR_SCENARIO_KEY: "YOUR SCENARIO KEY HERE"
YOUR_SCENARIO_SECRET_IF_ANY: "YOUR SCENARIO SECRET HERE"
```

4. **Set the environment:** In `run.py`, set the environment variables for your defined tokens and call the `process_spec_file` method with the path to your OpenAPI specification file.

```python
    elif scenario == "upclick":
        os.environ["UPCLICK_KEY"] = config["UPCLICK_KEY"]

        api_spec, headers = process_spec_file(
            file_path="specs/upclick_oas.json", token=os.environ["UPCLICK_KEY"]
        )

        headers["Content-Type"] = "application/json"
        query_example = "Get me my spaces of team on upclick"

    elif scenario == "your_scenario_name":
        os.environ["YOUR_SCENARIO_KEY"] = config["YOUR_SCENARIO_KEY"]
        os.environ["YOUR_SCENARIO_SECRET (Optional)"] = config["YOUR_SCENARIO_SECRET (Optional)"]

        api_spec, headers = process_spec_file(
            file_path="specs/your_scenario_name_oas.json", token=os.environ["YOUR_SCENARIO_KEY"]
        )
        query_example = "An example query from your scenario to set as default"


    elif scenario == "jira":
			# jira code here
    elif scenario == "trello":
			# trello code here
    elif scenario == "salesforce":
			# salesforce code here
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Unsupported scenario: {scenario}")
```

5. **Customize the output (optional):** Review the `process_spec_file()` method in `helper.py` and modify the condition for your scenario if you need any custom output.

```python
if "your_scenario_name" in file_path:
    headers = {
        'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'
    }
    return api_spec, headers
```

6. Go to `helper.py` file and review the `process_spec_file()` method to modify the
   condition of your scenario if you need any custom output from your scenario.
   The basic purpose of this method is to return the processed version of your
   provided original spec file and any headers which the API request accepts.

```python
def process_spec_file(file_path: str = None, token: str = None, key: str = None, username: str = None):
    with open(file_path) as f:
        raw_api_spec = json.load(f)

    api_spec = reduce_openapi_spec(raw_api_spec, only_required=False)

    if "trello" in file_path:
        params = {
            "key": key,
            "token": token
        }
        return api_spec, params

    if "jira" in file_path:
        credentials = f'{username}:{token}'
        encoded_credentials = b64encode(credentials.encode('utf-8')).decode('utf-8')
        headers = {
            'Authorization': f'Basic {encoded_credentials}'
        }
        return api_spec, headers

    if "salesforce" in file_path:
        headers = {
            'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'
        }
        return api_spec, headers

    if "your_scenario_name" in file_path:
        headers = {
            'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'
        }
        return api_spec, headers
```

### Step 3: Adding Examples üìö

Now, let's bring your scenario to life with illustrative examples!

1. Navigate to the `icl_examples` directory.

2. In the `api_selector` and `planner` directories, add examples of API calls specific to your scenario, following the same format as the existing examples such as `Spotify`, as shown below:

3. api_selector

```txt
Example 1:
Background: No background
User query: what is the id of album Kind of Blue.
API calling 1: GET /search to search for the album "Kind of Blue"
API response: Kind of Blue's album_id is 1weenld61qoidwYuZ1GESA

Example 2:
Background: No background
User query: get the newest album of Lana Del Rey (id 00FQb4jTyendYWaN8pK0wa).
API calling 1: GET /artists/00FQb4jTyendYWaN8pK0wa/albums to get the newest album of Lana Del Rey (id 00FQb4jTyendYWaN8pK0wa)

Plan step 3: make a playlist called "Love Coldplay"
API response: Successfully called GET /me to get the user id. The user id is xxxxxxxxx.
Plan step 4: Continue. make a playlist called "Love Coldplay"
API response: Successfully called POST /users/xxxxxxxxx/playlists to make a playlist called "Love Coldplay". The playlist id is 7LjHVU3t3fcxj5aiPFEW4T.
Plan step 5: Add the most popular songs by Coldplay, Yellow (3AJwUDP919kvQ9QcozQPxg), Viva La Vida (1mea3bSkSGXuIRvnydlB5b), to playlist "Love Coldplay" (7LjHVU3t3fcxj5aiPFEW4T)
API response: Successfully called POST /playlists/7LjHVU3t3fcxj5aiPFEW4T/tracks to add Yellow (3AJwUDP919kvQ9QcozQPxg), Viva La Vida (1mea3bSkSGXuIRvnydlB5b) in playlist "Love Coldplay" (7LjHVU3t3fcxj5aiPFEW4T). The playlist id is 7LjHVU3t3fcxj5aiPFEW4T.
Thought: I am finished executing a plan and have the data the used asked to create
Final Answer: I have made a new playlist called "Love Coldplay" containing Yellow and Viva La Vida by Coldplay.
```

3. Tailor these examples to match your scenario's unique use case.

## üö® Disclaimer

While the scenarios available in the application strive for universality, some may require slight adjustments based on their API interactions. Ensure that your specification file is correctly formatted for the agent's consumption. You can refer to other applications' specification files as formatting examples. Additionally, specification files often require minor modifications, such as removing the base URL from the API documentation paths.
